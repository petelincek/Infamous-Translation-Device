# Infamous-Translation-Device
Know that mic button in google translate to input your voice? This is him now, feel old yet?

Imagine waking up in the morning, watching some foregn streamer on Twitch.tv and seeing a translation box live translating his voice to english, and thinking:
"What if I try doing one myself, it can't be that hard right?", well it deppends. If by using existing translation libraries then no, if making them from sratch then yes.
At this point you can already tell which one I chose.

Well .. Enjoy this completely stable piece of code :)
